# Basic syntax

## Functions and arguments
Functions are called <dfn>verbs</dfn> in J.

J has two-argument, infix verbs. These are called <dfn>dyadic</dfn> verbs.

```J
   3 * 5
```
```
15
```
---
```J
   3 - 5
```
```
_2
```

Some verbs map between elements of their left and right argument arrays. It is easy to add lists of numbers together:
```J
   1 2 3 + 4 5 6
```
```
5 7 9
```

Negative numbers are written with an <dfn>underscore</dfn> `_` to differentiate between negation (`-3`) and literal negative numbers (`_3`).
```J
   1 2 3 - 1 0 _1
```
```
0 2 4
```

There are also one-argument, prefix verbs. These are called <dfn>monadic</dfn> verbs.
```J
   - 5 _3 0 _4 2
```
```
_5 3 0 4 _2
```
---
```J
   |. 1 2 3 4 5
```
```
5 4 3 2 1
```

All J built-ins are either one or two-character ASCII symbols.

Some symbols represent both a monadic and a dyadic verb, but these are often closely related. As we will see later, even user-defined verbs can be monadic, dyadic or even both (<dfn>ambivalent</dfn>).

**:bulb: Try this**: Use these verbs monadically and dyadically:

<div class="center language-J" markdown="span">
<div class="displayBox" markdown="span">
<a class="glyph" title="Conjugate/Plus">`+`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Negate/Minus">`-`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Signum/Times">`*`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Reciprocal/Divide">`%`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Magnitude/Residue">`|`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Exponential/Power">`^`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Natural Log/Logarithm">`^.`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Ceiling/Greater of/Max">`>.`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Floor/Lesser of/Min">`<.`</a>
</div>
</div>

## Singleton extension
Dyadic verbs can map between a single value and an array of values.
```J
   3 * 1 10 100
```
```
3 30 300
```
---
```J
   3 = 1 2 3 4 5
```
```
0 0 1 0 0
```

**:bulb: Try this**: Replace the verbs in the previous two expressions with:
<a class="glyph" title="Max">`>.`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Min">`<.`</a>
<a class="glyph" title="Less than">`<`</a>

While experimenting, you may cause a `LENGTH ERROR`:

```J
   1 2+3 4 5
```
```
|length error
|   1 2    +3 4 5
|[-0] 
```

Verbs such as `+ * >.` apply between elements of two arrays of the same shape, or between one element and many if one of the arguments is a single value. However, if the arrays are of two different shapes, it is not clear how the verb should be applied. Of course, you may want to [apply a verb between all combinations of elements of the left and right argument](./array-logic-data-driven-conditionals.md#the-outer-product), but that will be addressed soon enough.

## Order of execution
Expressions are executed from right to left.

```J
   10*i.2+5
```
```
0 10 20 30 40 50 60
```

??? Info "Show me step-by-step"
	To start, there is a literal number 5:
	```J
	   5
	5
	```
	
	Next, there is a plus `+` with a number 2 to its immediate left, so it is evaluated as two plus five:
	```J
	   2+5
	7
	```
	
	Then the symbol <dfn>idot</dfn> `i.`. To its left is another verb, times `*`, not a value. So the verb is called <em>monadically</em>. The monadic form of `i.` is the <dfn>index generator</dfn>, which generates an integer array of length defined by its right argument.
	```
	   i.2+5
	0 1 2 3 4 5 6
	```
	
	Lastly, another dyadic verb, we multiply our list by ten:
	```
	   10*i.2+5
	0 10 20 30 40 50 60
	```

The expression above is "ten *times* the indices from 0 to *two plus five*, or in short: "ten times idot two plus five". We can make it clearer using (superfluous) **parentheses** `()`.
```J
   10*(i.(2+5))
```
```
0 10 20 30 40 50 60
```

Of course, we can change the order of execution using different parentheses.

```J
   (10*i.2)+5
```
```
5 15
```

??? Info "Show me step-by-step"
	Beginning from the right, there is a literal number 5:
	```J
	   (10*i.2)+5
	            5
	```
	
	Then there is a plus symbol `+`. Before we can decide if it is being called monadically or dyadically, we must look to the left.
	
	```J
	      )+5
	```
	
	A right parenthesis. We must evaluate the contents of the parentheses to see if it is a verb or a value.
	
	```J
	   (10*i.2)
	```
	
	This expression evaluates to the list `0 10`. Since it is a value, it is used as the left argument to our plus verb.
	
	```J
	   (10*i.2)+5
	   (0   10)+5
	5 15
	```

Infix (dyadic) verbs have a **short** *left* scope and **long** *right* scope. This means that they take the result of everything to their right hand side as their right argument. 

If there is one, the left argument is the value to the <em>immediate</em> left.

However, juxtaposed values form lists <em>before</em> any verbs are applied. This is called <dfn>stranding</dfn> and lets us write very natural expressions, such as:

```J
   1 2 3 + 4 5 6
5 7 9
```

but this can lead to some surprises if we are not aware:

```J
   2 + 2 2 + 2
```
```
6 6
```

??? Info "Show me step-by-step"
	First, there is a literal number 2
	```J
	          2
	2
	```
	
	Then there is a symbol `+`. What, if any, is the value to its immediate left?
	```J
	       2 2 + 2
	```
	
	It is a 2-element vector `2 2`. The plus verb maps between these elements and the single number on the right:
	```J
	       2 2 + 2
	4 4
	```
	
	Finally there is another addition. The overall evaluation looks like the following:
	```J
	   2 + 2 2 + 2
	   2 + 4 4
	   6 6
	```

## Comments
Anything after a _nota bene_ symbol `NB.` is ignored.

```J
   NB. nothing happens on this line
   2 * 3 NB. 4 5
```
```
6
```
---
```J
   'A'   NB. It means "note well"
```
```
A
```

## The reduction operator
Adding a list of numbers *could* become very tedious...
```J
   1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10+11+12+13+14+15
```
```
120
```

The **insert** [adverb](./Operators.md) `u/` inserts the verb `u` to its left between parts of the right argument array.
```J
   +/1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```
```
120
```

It is called *insert* because it has the effect of inserting the verb to its left between each element of its right argument. As a reduction operation, it also reduces the number of dimensions of its argument. In the example above, we have a **vector** (1 dimensional, list) argument and return a **scalar** (0 dimensional, single value) result.

## The index generator
The index generator `i. y` generates integers up to the integer right argument `y`
```J
   i.10
```
```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```

**Note:** APL's `‚ç≥` starts at `1`, while J's `i.` starts at 0.

So we can do an arithmetic sum as follows

|**Traditional Mathematical Notation (TMN)** | **J** |
|---|---|
| $\sum_{n=1}^N n$ | `+/i.N`

## What do these errors mean?

In the APL and BQN versions of this lesson, a negative number passed as the right argument to the index generator function produces an error. How can an item in an array have a negative index?

In J, `i. y` treats a negative `y` as a signal to reverse the order of the indices produced:

```J
   i._4
```
```
3 2 1 0
```

Here's another error you might encounter:

```J
   1+
```
|syntax error
|       1+
|[-0] 
```

A `syntax error` means that the expression which you tried to execute does not make sense. In the case above, it is because verbs always either take a single argument to their right or two arguments, one to the right and one to the left. Verbs never take a single argument to their left.

```J
   a
|value error: a
|[-0]
```

A `value error` means that there is nothing associated with the name provided. We have not seen any named verbs or variables yet; nothing has been assigned to the name `a`, so trying to use it in an expression is meaningless.

## Problem Set 1
1.   
	The average daily temperatures, in degrees Celcius, for 7 days are stored in a variable `t_allweek`.
	
	```J
	t_allweek =: 11.7 8.6 9.7 14.2 6.7 11.8 9.2
	```
	
	Use J to compute the follwing:
	
	1. The highest daily temperature
	1. The lowest daily temperature
	1. The range of (difference between the largest and the smallest) temperatures
	1. Each temperature rounded to the nearest whole number

		   >./ 5 1.9 3 7.5 0 5.1 2.5
		   7.5
		```
		
		> if we use parentheses `()` to force J to compute the maximum of the list before doing subtraction, we only do a single subtraction instead of 7:
		```J
		   ( >./t_allweek ) - <./ t_allweek
		   ( >./t_allweek ) - 6.7
		   (     14.2    ) - 6.7
		   7.5

		<li>
		To round to the nearest whole number, either add 0.5 and round down:
		```J
		   <.0.5+t_allweek
		12 9 10 14 7 12 9

		or subtract 0.5 and round up:

1. A Mathematical Notation

	Use J to evaluate the following

	1. $\prod_{n=1}^{12} n$ (multiply together the first twelve integers)

	1. $\sum_{n=1}^{17}n^2$ (add together the first seventeen squared integers)

	1. $\sum_{n=1}^{100}2n$ (add together the first one hundred positive even integers)

	1. $\sum_{n=1}^{100}2n-1$ (add together the first one hundred odd integers)

	1. In TMN, the following expression is equal to `0`, why does the following return `70` in J?
		```J
		   84 - 12 - 1 - 13 - 28 - 9 - 6 - 15  
		```
		```
		70
		```

		   +/*:1+i.17    NB. Using Square

		```
		The first version using Power `^` requires parentheses, since without parentheses we get the sum of the first 289 integers (17 squared), instead of the first 17 integers squared.

		|TMN|J|
		|---|---|
		|$\sum_n^{17^2} n$|`+/1+i.17^2`
		|$\sum_n^{17} n^2$|`+/1+(i.17)^2`|

		The second formulation using the Square `*:` verb directly avoids this.

		<li>
		```J

		<li>
		We can either subtract 1 from the even numbers:
		```J
		   +/(2*1+i.100)-1
		10000
		```

		or we can add negative 1:
		```J
		   +/_1+2*1+i.100
     10000
		```
		The underscore denotes a literal negative, whereas the hyphen indicates subtraction.

		Remember the right-to-left rule: verbs take everything to their right, and the first thing to their left. We can add unnecessary parentheses to show how J evaluates our expression.
